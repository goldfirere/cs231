FEEDBACK

give solutions to TAs for help sessions?
students should fix TA grading mistakes
don't skip sections (partial order relations)
sometimes sections were covered *after* homework was due -- build more slack into schedule
students might do all homework at once -- take into account
HW due on first day of week?
make extra help session with solutions available
more feedback from TAs about why things are wrong
extra discussion session to discuss HW
dedicated class time to problem solving is good
interactive lectures are different from videos
videos can't read the board
think about camera position. test!!!
course too packed -- make full year!

don't allow emailed assignments. Have students work together to get assignments in. Otherwise,
it becomes my problem!

Nested Quantifiers

- examples
- exercise
- negations
- "multiply-quantified"
- order matters!

- Negate: "Everybody loves somebody"
- Negate: "Somebody knows everyone in the room."


Arguments with Quantifiers

- (∀ x, P(x) → Q(x)) ⇒ P(a) ⇒ Q(a)
- (Everyone who tries succeeds) -> (Robin tries) -> (Robin succeeds)
- This is **instantiation**
- (∀ x, P(x) → Q(x)) ⇒ ¬Q(a) ⇒ ¬P(a)    <-- "modus tollens"

- "All computer scientists take discrete math", "Robin takes discrete math" ⇏
  "Robin is a computer scientist"

Goals of course
---------------

<div id="goals">

By the end of this course, you will be able to...

* reason about problems using formal mathematical logic
* write inductive proofs
* apply combinatorial techniques to estimate probabilities
* describe the shape of a variety of discrete structures

During the course, you will...

* write proofs
* use precise mathematical reasoning

</div>

This is a course in discrete mathematics, the branch of mathematics
that underpins computer science and number theory. The word *discrete*
means "individually separate and distinct". Applied to mathematics, this
word means that we will be studying the behavior of mathematical structures
that can be considered as individual, distinct units: for example, we
will study integers, not the real numbers; or we will study *true* and
*false*, not the unit interval (that is, the range of numbers between 0
and 1).

A key part of any mathematical investigation is *proof*. In this course,
we will do many proofs by *induction*, a powerful technique where local
reasoning can be used to prove global properties. Along the way, we will
also discuss a variety of discrete structures, including Boolean algebra,
the natural numbers, sets, functions over sets, trees, and graphs.
We will also use our knowledge to delve into combinatorics, the mathematics
of counting; combinatorics underly much of probability and data science.

This course does *not* build on calculus or linear algebra. Instead, it
explores separate areas of mathematics. Work in this course will be all
pencil-and-paper; there will be no computer programming.

Materials
=========

<div id="materials">

The **required** textbook for the course is:

* **Discrete Mathematics with Applications**, Fourth Edition, by Susanna S. Epp. It is available at the bookstore.

  Known [errata](http://condor.depaul.edu/sepp/DMwA4e.htm) for this book are posted.

Recommended reading:

These two books offer nice background and motivation for the material in this course.

* **How to Bake &pi;: An Edible Exploration of the Mathematics of
    Mathematics**, by Eugenia Cheng, available online through the [library](https://catalog.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/find/Record/.b4495405). This breezy,
    light-hearted book is the best articulation I've read of why math is fun
    and important. It specifically motivates a branch of mathematics called
    *category theory*, which is not studied in this course. However, really,
    it just motivates mathematical thinking. Feel free to skip most of Part II of
    the book (the part on category theory), but don't miss the last chapter, which
    is a gem and does not depend on the category theory material.

* **G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach: An eternal golden braid**, by Douglas R. Hofstadter, available
at the [library](https://catalog.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/find/Record/.b1996022). This classic
explores mathematics and computer science through logic, with an emphasis on recursion. It
was written for a non-specialist audience.

And I can't help but recommend

* **Alice's Adventures in Wonderland**, by Lewis Carroll, available [online](https://catalog.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/find/Record/.b3921547) and in [book](https://catalog.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/find/Record/.b1341876) form at the library. This classic piece of children's fiction, written by
a professor of mathematics, explores logic as seen through the eyes of a child.

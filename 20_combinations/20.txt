Addition Rule
 - N(A ∪ B) = N(A) + N(B) when A and B are disjoint (generalize to mut. disjoint)
 - Actually, N(A ∪ B) = N(A) + N(B) - N(A ∩ B)
 - And N(A ∪ B ∪ C) = N(A) + N(B) + N(C) - N(A ∩ B) - N(B ∩ C) - N(A ∩ C) + N(A ∩ B ∩ C)

Pigeonhole Principle
 - Problems from book. (but not 11, 16, 19, 30, or 32)

Combinations

Questions:
 - If i = j - 1, then why can we change Σⱼ to Σᵢ?
 - Why is proof by contradiction not proving the negation? Is it because it's
   actually disproving the negation?  A: YES!
 - When test back? How is the grading done?
 - Further explain factorial expression.
 - How do we get "All ints > 11 are the sum of two composites" without the hint?
 - What will we do with Σ and Π?
 - How do I recommend you work for this class? (e.g., alone, with TAs, etc.)
 - Why use proof by contraposition? A: Because taking the contrapositive is often
   easier than taking a negation!

{-

∀ n ∈ ℤ, n > 11 → ∃ a,b ∈ ℤ, comp(a) ∧ comp(b) ∧ a + b = n

Negation:
∃ n ∈ ℤ, n > 11 ∧ ∀ a,b ∈ ℤ, prime(a) ∨ prime (b) ∨ a + b ≠ n

We have n with n > 11.

Split into cases:
 Case n is even:
  It must be that prime(4) ∨ prime(n-4). But 4 isn't prime, and neither is n-4 (b/c it's even)
  and not 2.

 Case n is odd:
  It must be that prime(9) ∨ prime(n-9). But 9 isn't prime, and neither is n-9 (b/c it's even
  and not 2).

 QED.

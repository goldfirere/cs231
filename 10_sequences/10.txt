I. Questions?
II. Proof by contradiction
III. Sequences

Pf by contradiction:
 - There is no least positive rational number.

Sequences:
 find an expression for 1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6, ...

 Σ-notation
  - expanding to ... notation
  - contracting to Σ notation
  - removing and adding a term
  - telescoping sums: find an expression for Σk

 Π-notation

Properties of sums & products:
 - Σa + Σb = Σ(a+b)
 - cΣa = Σ(ca)  (but make sure it's a constant)
 - (Πa)(Πb) = Π(ab)
 but make sure the bounds are the same!!

change of variable

Factorials

n-choose-r
 - n choose r = n! / (r! (n-r)!)

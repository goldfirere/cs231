Introductions (10:10-10:25)
 - who I am, very briefly
 - who you are

Review (10:25-10:45)
 - questions??
 - Statements (universals / existentials)
 - Sets
 - Relations

Boolean algebra (10:45-11:00)
  - A "statement" is true or false.
  - Examples.
  - ~
  - ∧ (conjunction)
  - ∨ (disjunction)
  - You can nest these.
  - Logical equivalence: ≡
  - DeMorgan's

Implications (11:00-11:15)
 - truth table for P ⇒ Q.
 - If it's September 31, then I'll bring everyone cookies.
 - (P ⇒ Q) ≡ (¬P ∨ Q)
 - Contrapositives
   - Work out the boolean algebra
 - iff ≡ P ↔ Q
 - "necessary"
 - "sufficient"
   - Being Monday is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for us having class.
   - Monday 9/11 is sufficient.
 - "If you eat your dinner, you will get dessert."

Arguments (11:15-11:30)
 - Sequence of statements leading to an irrefutable condition.
 - Modus ponens
 - Modus tollens (= modus ponens of contrapositive)
 - P → (P ∨ Q)
 - (P ∧ Q) → P
 - ((P ∧ Q) ∧ ¬Q) → P
 - (P → Q) ∧ (Q → R) ⇒ (P → R)
 - Fallacies:
    - Converse: Thinking (P → Q) implies (Q → P)
       - Ex: If it's raining, I will carry an umbrella.
       - Can we conclude anything if I am carrying an umbrella?
    - Inverse: Thinking (P → Q) ⇒ (¬P → ¬Q)
       - Ex: Can we conclude anything if it's not raining?
    - NB: Inverse and converse are contrapositivies
    - Draw little table
 - Contadictions:
    (¬P → c) ⇒ P

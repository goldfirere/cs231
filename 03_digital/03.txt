I. Administrivia
II. Questions
III. Digital Circuitry
IV. A bit of arithmetic

Administrivia (10:10-10:25)
 - names
 - Piazza
 - survey
 - groups

Questions (10:25-10:40)
 - Rewrite only with ∧ and ¬: (p → r) ↔ (q → r)

Digital Circuitry: (10:40-11:00)
 - AND
 - OR
 - NOT
 - examples
 - truth tables (via volunteer)
 - NAND
 - NOR
 - write a boolean expression corresponding to a circuit
 - vice versa
 - simplify and draw circuit (maybe have students try first):
    (P ∧ Q) ∨ (¬P ∧ Q) ∨ (¬P ∧ ¬Q)

Arithmetic (11:00-11:30)
 - binary representation
 - converting to/from binary (table lookup method)
    - Try for yourself!
 - arithmetic
 - adders:
   - half: S = P ⊕ Q; C = P ∧ Q
   - whole: S = P ⊕ Q ⊕ R; C = (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R) ∨ (Q ∧ R)
 - A "two's complement" w.r.t n is 2ⁿ - a.
 - Finding the two's complement: flip the bits and add 1
 - Finding two's complement is involutive!
 - representation of negative numbers
 - hex notation as an abbreviation

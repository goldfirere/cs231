Questions? (10:10-10:25)

Proofs (10:25-10:30)
 - I don't really care about properties of integers
 - I care about *techniques*

 - Equality is an equivalence relation
 - Definition of even numbers
 - Definition of prime/composite

Existentials (10:30-10:50)
 - EX: sum of evens is even
 - EX: product of evens is even
 - disproofs of universals
 - EX: all prime numbers are odd
 - EX: half of every even number is even

Universals (10:50-11:05)
 - method of exhaustion
 - Generalization: Proving ∀ x ∈ S, P(x) by choosing a ∈ S and showing P(a)
    - "opposite" of instantiation
    - key detail: you know nothing about a!

 - EX: ∀ x,y ∈ E, x + y ∈ E.
    --> "existential instantiation". But don't use an existing name!
    --> BAD: ∀ x,y ∈ E, x = y.
    --> BAD: ∀ x,y ∈ E, x ≠ y.

 - EX: ∀ x,y ∈ P, xy ∉ P.

EXERCISE: (11:05-11:20)
 Disprove: ∃ n ∈ Z, 6n² + 27 ∈ P.

Writing proofs (11:20-11:30)
 - Theorem. Proof. QED.
 - Don't be stingy with paper!
 - "Every complete, bipartite graph is connected"

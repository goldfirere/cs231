I. Questions?
II. Predicates
III. Quantifiers
IV. Negations

Questions (10:10-10:20)

Predicates (10:20-10:30)
 - "is a student in this class"
 - "is an American city"
 - P(x) = x > 0
 - P(x) = x is prime
 - P(x,y) = x is a divisor of y
 - What is the difference between a predicate and a statement?
   --> Ans: predicates have free variables
 - "truth set"

Quantifiers (10:30-10:45)
 - ∀ = for all
 - syntax
 - semantics
 - it turns predicates into statements
 - examples from above

 - ∃ = exists
 - examples

 - translations: see book.

 - EXERCISE: Work in your groups to pose translation questions to others.
   (10:45-11:15)

Negations (11:15-11:30)
 - Negate "All computer scientists take discrete math"
 - ¬∀ = ∃; ¬∃ = ∀.
 - ∀ = ∧; ∃ = ∨.
 - vacuous ∀. can prove via negation

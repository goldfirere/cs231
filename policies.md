Homework assignments
====================

Assignments will be given a numerical grade based on correctness and clarity of exposition.

Homework will be collected weekly, on Wednesdays; the problems are listed on the [syllabus](syllabus.html).
Problems listed next to a given date are to be *started* on that date. They will be
collected on the following Wednesday.

Students are allowed one late submission (up to a week late). You do not have to ask for this automatic extension.
Any further lateness will get a 50% penalty
on that assignment. Homework submitted more than a week late will not be graded.

You are encouraged to work together on assignments, but you must write up your own solutions.

GitHub
======

The course materials are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/goldfirere/cs231).
Feel free to submit corrections/ask clarifications there, via GitHub's [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
or [issues](https://github.com/goldfirere/cs231/issues) mechanisms.

Accommodations for disability
=============================

Bryn Mawr College is committed to providing equal access to students with a
documented disability. Students needing academic accommodations for a
disability must first register with Access Services. Students can call
610-526-7516 to make an appointment with the Coordinator of Access Services,
Deb Alder, or [email her](mailto:dalder@brynmawr.edu) at `dalder@brynmawr.edu`
to begin this confidential process. Once registered, students should schedule
an appointment with me as early in the semester as possible to share the
verification form and make appropriate arrangements. Please note that
accommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice to implement.
More information can be obtained at the [Access Services
website](http://www.brynmawr.edu/access_services/).

Email
=====

I use email heavily as a way of communicating with students and colleagues.
Accordingly, I expect all my students to check email daily at their college
email address. There may be important announcements / corrections / other
messages there. Please read them!

As an avid emailer, I also am happy to receive email from all of you. During
business hours, you can expect a response from me within a few hours of your
email -- often much sooner. After 5pm or so, I tend to take a break from
technology for several hours, either until 9pm or even until the next morning.
Do *not* expect me to respond to an email in the evening. Similarly, entire
weekends go by without my checking my email (the nicer the weather, the less
chance of a response!), and so it's possible that something
you send on a Friday evening won't reach me until Monday morning.

In an emergency, you may call me at home at 484-344-5924 or on my cell at
201-575-6474. No texts, please.

Another small point about email: I have two Bryn Mawr email addresses:
`rae@cs.brynmawr.edu` and `raeisenber@brynmawr.edu`. Both email addresses
go to the same place, though, and both work. You do not need to worry about
which one you send to.

Meetings
========

My office hours for Fall 2017 are Tuesdays 1:30-3:30.
This means that, at
these hours, I am guaranteed to be in my office and expecting visitors -- and
I really do want visitors. During class, it's hard to get to know all of you,
and I'd love to know more about what brought you into my class, what else
you're interested in (in computer science/math and more broadly), and how your
college experience is going generally. Come with a question, come to say hi,
or come to play one of my puzzles. You can even use your curiosity about my
puzzle collection as an excuse to get in the door.

If you have a conflict with my office hours, please email so we can find another
time to meet.

Beyond my office hours, I aim to have an open-door policy. If you see my
office door (Park 204) open, please interrupt me: that's why the door is
open!

For a broader discussion than just homework questions, I'd be happy to join
you for lunch in the dining hall. Just email or ask!

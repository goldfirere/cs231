I. Functions
II. Composition
III. Relations

Functions
 - action on sets
 - subtraction / addition
 - identity
 - equality
 - types

Composition
 - injective ∘ injective = injective
 - surjective ∘ surjective = surjective
 - composition/identity
 - composition/inverse

 Activity: prove that the injectivity and surjectivity properties. Swap papers and give feedback.

Relations
 - inverses always exist
 - "endorelation"
 - n-ary relations
 - reflexivity
 - symmetry
 - transitivity
 - "equivalence relation"
 - closures (book only talks about transitive)

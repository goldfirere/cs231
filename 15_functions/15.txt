Handshake problem, #29 from 5.2 or 5.3
 As each of a group of businesspeople arrives at a meeting, each
 shakes hands with all the other people present. Use
 mathematical induction to show that if n people come to
 the meeting then [n(n-1)]/2 handshakes occur.

Set properties
 - A ∩ B ⊆ A  and   A ∩ B ⊆ B
 - A ⊆ A ∪ B  and   B ⊆ A ∪ B
 - transitivity

 - technique: unroll definitions; recall X ∪ Y = {z | z ∈ X ∨ z ∈ Y}

 - x ∈ X ∪ Y   ↔   x ∈ X ∨ x ∈ Y
 - x ∈ X ∩ Y   ↔   x ∈ X ∧ x ∈ Y
 - x ∈ X - Y   ↔   x ∈ X ∧ x ∉ Y
 - x ∈ Xᶜ      ↔   x ∉ X
 - (x, y) ∈ X × Y  ↔  x ∈ X ∧ y ∈ Y

 - Prove (6.2.13): For all sets A, B, and C, if A ⊆ B then A ∩ C ⊆ B ∩ C.


- Boolean algebras
  --> useful in research!
- Russell's Paradox
   S = { A | A is a set and A ∉ A }
   infinite hierarchies of universes
   
- Halting Problem
   Suppose CheckHalt(X, D) where X is an algorithm and D is its input.
   But an algorithm can be an input.
   Define Test(X) to:
     - loop forever if CheckHalt(X, X) prints "halts"
     - halt if CheckHalt(X, X) prints "loops forever"
   What does Test(Test) do ?? ????? ???????????
   

Function properties
 - one-to-one, aka injective
 - onto, aka surjective
 - "one-to-one correspondence", aka bijection

7.2.21. Let S be the set of all strings of 0s and 1s, and define
  ℓ: S → ℤnonneg by

     ℓ(s) = the length of s,  for all strings s in S

a. Is ℓ injective? Prove or give a counterexample.
b. Is ℓ surjective? Prove or give a counterexample.
